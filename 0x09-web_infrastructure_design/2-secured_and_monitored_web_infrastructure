# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design Explanation

## Overview

This is a three-server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com with enhanced security, encryption, and monitoring.

## Components

- 3 Servers
- 1 Web Server (Nginx)
- 1 Application Server
- 1 Database (MySQL)
- 3 Firewalls (one on each server)
- 1 SSL Certificate for HTTPS
- 3 Monitoring Clients (data collectors)
- 1 Load Balancer (HAproxy)

## Why Additional Components?

### Firewalls (3)

Firewalls are added to control and filter network traffic to and from each server:

- They act as security barriers between networks
- They enforce access control policies, blocking unauthorized access
- They help prevent various network attacks
- Each server has its own firewall to maintain security even if one server is compromised

### SSL Certificate

SSL is implemented to enable HTTPS:

- Encrypts traffic between clients and the website
- Establishes secure connections to protect sensitive data
- Authenticates the identity of the website to users
- Builds trust with users and improves search engine rankings

### Monitoring Clients

The monitoring system (like Sumologic) is added to:

- Track server health and performance in real-time
- Detect and alert on anomalies and potential issues
- Collect data for analysis and optimization
- Enable proactive problem resolution before users are affected

## How Monitoring Works

Monitoring clients (data collectors) installed on each server:

1. Collect various metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, application performance, etc.)
2. Gather logs from system and application processes
3. Send this data to a central monitoring service
4. The monitoring service analyzes, visualizes, and alerts based on this data

To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second):

1. Configure the monitoring client to collect web server access logs
2. Set up a metric that counts HTTP requests per time interval
3. Create dashboards to visualize this data
4. Set up alerting thresholds for abnormal QPS values

## Issues With This Infrastructure

### SSL Termination at Load Balancer

Terminating SSL at the load balancer creates issues:

- Traffic between load balancer and servers is unencrypted (internal network vulnerability)
- Reduces end-to-end encryption security
- Creates a single point of decryption that could be targeted

### Single Write Database

Having only one MySQL server for writes is problematic:

- Creates a single point of failure for write operations
- Limits write scalability as database load increases
- Potential data loss if the primary database fails before replication

### Homogeneous Server Components

Having identical components on all servers presents challenges:

- No specialization for specific workloads (database vs. web serving)
- Inefficient resource utilization (databases need more memory, web servers need more CPU)
- Security vulnerabilities affect all servers the same way
- Maintenance becomes more complex
- Scaling becomes less flexible as you can't scale specific components independently
